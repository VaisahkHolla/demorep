SPA-Single Page Application
Multiple templates available on client side which will be loaded as and when needed
MVVM-Model View View Model
MVP-Model View Presenter
MV*-Model View Anything

MVVM-2 way data binding, updating view if model changes and vice versa, Angular uses this
React doesn't do this so we use

JSX-js and Html
Html and js to be together
Virtual DOM
Rendered elmenets are copied and a copy is kept so that it can be used,update only the changes to the dom(the copy)
and update only those in the original dom
In memory representation
Isomorphic Rendering-both client and server side

React+Angular is also used for quicker Rendering

React deals with View 
connecting view and controller through react is also possible. Why need for connection is SPA

2 way data binding is risky so we are not following MVVM
following FLUX pattern

updating dom is expensive
with virtual dom, we compare dom's current state to desired new state... Update the dom in the most eff way
without virtual dom, we just blindly update dom using new state

shouldComponentUpdate

npm install --save react@^0.14.8
npm install --save react-dom@^0.14.8
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-react@^6.23.0
npm install: This will install all the files in package.json not in the folder

Component based framework:The Component has a well defined state and behavior

NodeJS:const React=requrie('react');const Component=requrie('react').Component;
module.exports=App;

ES2015: import React,{Component} from 'react';
export default class App extends Component{

}

Props: Looks like HTML attributes but immutable
this.props.username
State: Holds mutable state
this.props.username
State will be recieved as props
Child will recieve state as props from the parent 

Data flow from parent to child
Event flow from child to parent

All tags hsould be neclosed in a single parent tag(can be any)
If component is not binded, it will be treated as un
inside render function the logic for functionality is done
presentation components are stateless
